# Random-Quote-Generator
- A Random Quote Generator is capable of pulling quotes randomly from an API. I designed it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and type.fit API.
- Each time you reload the page or click on the new quote button, then the quote will be changed randomly.
- You can share the quote on Twitter by clicking the share button.
